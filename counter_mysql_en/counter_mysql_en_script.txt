The PHP counter needs a MySQL database to store the counter portfolio. Should you not have a MySQL database, please use our text counter Text counter. We recommend the MySQL version for websites with many visitors and larger pages.

The following spreadsheets need to be installed in order to operate the counter. The simplest method is to implement the following lines in PHPMyAdmin.

CREATE TABLE `counter_ips` (
  `ip` varchar(15) NOT NULL,
  `visit` datetime NOT NULL,
  UNIQUE KEY `ip` (`ip`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

CREATE TABLE `counter_values` (
  `id` bigint(11) NOT NULL,
  `day_id` bigint(11) NOT NULL,
  `day_value` bigint(11) NOT NULL,
  `yesterday_id` bigint(11) NOT NULL,
  `yesterday_value` bigint(11) NOT NULL,
  `week_id` bigint(11) NOT NULL,
  `week_value` bigint(11) NOT NULL,
  `month_id` bigint(11) NOT NULL,
  `month_value` bigint(11) NOT NULL,
  `year_id` bigint(11) NOT NULL,
  `year_value` bigint(11) NOT NULL,
  `all_value` bigint(11) NOT NULL,
  `record_date` datetime NOT NULL,
  `record_value` bigint(11) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
The installation consists of copying both counter.gif and counter.php files into the main directory of your homepage, set up the spreadsheets (see above ) and enter the MySQL link parameters (available from your web host).

Your counter can then be incorporated via

<?php include "counter.php"; ?>
in your homepage.

Please refer to our FAQs should you need assistance with the installation. It also explains how the counter can be integrated in .html files.

The advertising in the counter may only be removed when you acquire a license.
